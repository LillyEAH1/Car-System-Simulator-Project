# 🚗 Car Dynamics Simulator

# Overview
This project simulates the functionality of a car, starting with the ignition and ending with the verification that the clutch has been correctly engaged. Designed to demonstrate fundamental programming skills and a modular approach, this project is a great showcase of system-level thinking using C++.

## Features
- **Engine Control**: Simulates the ignition and engine behavior.
- **Clutch System**: Validates clutch engagement and functionality.
- **Modular Design**: Organized components (e.g., wheels, chassis) enable better scalability and maintainability.
- **Real-World Application**: Uses automotive principles as a learning analogy.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Language**: C++
- **IDE**: Visual Studio / Code::Blocks (or specify the one used) / or use Dev C++
- **Compilation**: GCC (or specify the compiler used)
